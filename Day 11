🗓️ Day 11 – Crypto30 Journey

Planned:
- Catch up on networking chapters
- Continue TryHackMe practicals

Actual:
- Took time to recover from illness (Sunday–Tuesday)
- Refocused priorities and restructured goals (Wednesday)
- Officially transitioned from NetCrypto30 → Crypto30
- Outlined plan for remaining 2 weeks of cryptography module

Key Learnings:
- You can’t do everything at once — sometimes growth means letting go.
- Rest is not failure; it’s part of the process.
- Focused consistency beats scattered effort.

Next Steps:
- Resume content updates
- Build cryptography flashcards
- Complete TryHackMe Encryption 101 and Cryptography Intro
- Practice RSA encryption and test ciphers
- Explore LabEx’s Cryptography for Beginners course
