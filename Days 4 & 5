📅 Day 4 — NetCrypto30
Date: 2025-11-06

Planned:
- Finish networking chapter one and do a written lab
- Cryptography pages 22 to 28 and chapter two pages 33 to 40
- Cisco Packet Tracer 30 minutes
- IBM networking course 30 minutes
- Read networking chapter four

What I actually did:
- Joined group for a networking design project for Technova Limited (HR 50 users, Finance 30 users, IT 20 users)
- Ended up as group leader despite being least experienced in networking
- Used AI extensively to guide the group and clarify unclear instructions
- Built the topology and reached step two, then laptop froze and I lost my work when I restarted — file was gone
- Completed Cryptography chapter 1 pages 22 to 28 and chapter 2 pages 33 to 40
- Did 30 minutes of IBM networking content

Key learnings:
- Leadership can feel messy when you are still learning, and that is okay
- Teaching and guiding others takes patience and repetition
- Always save work often and use backups or version control for topology files
- Hybrid crypto systems exist for performance reasons. Asymmetric for secure key exchange. Symmetric for fast data encryption. Efficiency is the driver.

📅 Day 5 — NetCrypto30
Date: 2025-11-07

Planned:
- Revisit networking chapters 1 and 4
- Redo the lost topology work
- Read Cryptography chapter 2 pages 40 to 46
- Complete Cisco Packet Tracer practice
- Complete IBM networking modules
- Start TryHackMe Encryption 101 and RSA explorer tool

What I actually did:
- Completed my Cisco Packet Tracer course and my IBM networking module
- Skimmed TryHackMe Encryption 101 and an RSA encryption website. Both are useful but I only skimmed due to time
- Continued reflections about how to know when you truly understand something
- Planned to redo the topology and rewatch the Wednesday lecture tomorrow when I have more focus time

Key learnings:
- Understanding is more than memorization. It is being able to place concepts in a larger puzzle and explain them to yourself and others
- Self-study lacks external permission to move forward. I need to create my own milestones and accept imperfect understanding as progress
- Keep moving forward. Adjust, repeat, and move on when needed. That mindset frees me to keep learning without being paralyzed by not knowing everything
