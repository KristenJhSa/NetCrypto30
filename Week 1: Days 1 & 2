# NetCrypto30 – Week 1: Foundations — OSI, TCP/IP & Crypto Basics

---

## **Week 1 Goals (ongoing):**  
1. Complete Cisco Packet Tracer exercises.  
2. Complete IBM Computer Networking Basics course.  
3. Stay up-to-date with Networking readings (Chapters 1 & 4).  
4. Progress through Cryptography Basics (Chapters 1–2).  
5. Document learning daily for accountability and portfolio development. 

**Dates:**  
- Day 1: November 3, 2025  
- Day 2: November 4, 2025  

**Focus for Week 1:**  
- **Networking:** OSI Model, TCP/IP Fundamentals (Chapters 1 & 4 of Networking Textbook)  
- **Cryptography Basics:** Chapters 1–2

## **Day 1 – November 3, 2025**  

**Planned:**  
- Networking: Read Chapter 1 – OSI Overview and Advantages  
- Cryptography: Chapter 1, Pages 9–16 – Basic Terms, What Makes a Cipher  
- Cisco Packet Tracer: 15 minutes  
- IBM Networking Basics course: Complete slides  

**What I actually did:**  
- **Networking:** Did not complete Chapter 1 reading due to time constraints.  
- **Cryptography:** Completed Chapter 1 reading (pages 9–16). Explored basic terms, what makes a cipher, and experimented with older ciphers.  
- **Cisco Packet Tracer:** 15 minutes of hands-on work. Learned that PCs and laptops can connect to networking devices via console or USB for management and configuration. Had fun with troubleshooting wireless routers and backup routers.  
- **IBM Computer Networking Basics course:** Completed 5 slides (~15 minutes). Struggling to maintain focus, but committed to progress.  

**Reflections & Learnings:**  
- Cisco Packet Tracer is fun and helped me understand device connectivity.  
- Learning ciphers reinforced the foundational concepts of cryptography.  
- Need to develop a better learning system for networking content.

## **Day 2 – November 4, 2025**  

**Planned:**  
- Networking: Continue Chapter 1 reading  
- Cryptography: Chapter 1, Pages 17–21 – Hash & XOR  
- Cisco Packet Tracer: 15 minutes  
- IBM Networking Basics course: Continue slides  

**What I actually did:**  
- **Networking:** Did not even bother reading; time was limited due to rigorous lecture and class support duties. And networking is boring. 
- **Cryptography:** Completed reading pages 17–21. Learned about hashes (one-way functions for integrity) and XOR operations. Reviewed asymmetric and symmetric encryption concepts, including public/private keys.  
- **Cisco Packet Tracer:** Completed another 15 minutes of hands-on practice.  
- **IBM Computer Networking Basics course:** Could not progress due to class workload. Will catch up on Day 3.  

**Reflections & Learnings:**  
- Hashes ensure data integrity and cannot be decrypted; differences in hashes indicate tampering.  
- Asymmetric encryption uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt.  
- Leading a review session helped reinforce my understanding of symmetric encryption and allowed me to perform a live example with classmates.  
- Still need to allocate focused time for networking theory to stay on track.

**Summary:**  
The first two days of **NetCrypto30** have been a mix of hands-on learning, reading, and reflection. While networking theory remains a challenge, hands-on cryptography and Packet Tracer exercises have been motivating and insightful. I am committed to catching up and maintaining steady progress over the next 28 days.
