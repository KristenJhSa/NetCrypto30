## 📅 Day 3 — NetCrypto30 Challenge

**Date:** November 5, 2025

### 🗓️ What I Planned to Do

* Finish Chapter 1 of Networking and start on a written lab
* Read pages 22–28 of *Cryptography for Dummies* and learn about cryptosystems and real-world use cases
* Spend 15 minutes in Cisco Packet Tracer
* Do a short session from my IBM Networking course

---

### 💻 What Actually Happened

* Spent the morning fixing up my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Instagram profiles
* Attended my regular 4-hour *Women Techsters* lecture focused on **asymmetric cryptography** and **RSA**
* Rewatched the entire lecture at 1.2x speed because I didn’t get it the first time
* Followed through the RSA steps again using small numbers to understand the math
* Practiced with GPG commands (key generation, symmetric and asymmetric encryption)
* Realized the difference between “doing” encryption and *understanding* encryption

---

### 🔑 Key Learnings

* It’s completely normal not to understand new concepts on the first try
* Watching lectures again (even faster) helps connect the dots after some hands-on practice
* The toughest part isn’t getting commands to run — it’s grasping *why* they work
* Understanding cryptography will take repetition, not memorization
* The “if it works, don’t touch it” mindset doesn’t apply here — I *have* to touch it to learn

### 📘 Next Steps

My manager gave me three extra resources to strengthen my foundation before diving deeper:

1. **TryHackMe – Encryption 101**
2. **TryHackMe – Cryptography Intro**
3. **RSA Encryption Explorer (web tool)**: https://muirlandoracle.co.uk/2020/01/29/rsa-encryption/

Planning to tackle all three on **Friday**, when I’ll (hopefully) have the most time to myself.

### 🧭 Reflection

Today was a reminder that progress isn’t always visible.
Even if I didn’t finish my checklist, I spent hours building understanding — and that counts.
This journey is going to take practice, patience, and a lot of “rewatch and retry” moments.
