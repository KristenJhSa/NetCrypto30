# 🚀 NetCrypto30 — My Networking & Cryptography Journey

**By Kristen | Women Techsters Fellow | Cybersecurity Track | Forever Learner**

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to my **NetCrypto30** project — a 30-day challenge where I’m catching up on **Networking** while keeping pace with **Cryptography**.

This journey is about showing up every day, learning consistently, and sharing my progress publicly to stay accountable and inspire others who might be learning under tough conditions.

> Every router mistake, every broken lab, and every concept that finally clicks — it all counts.
