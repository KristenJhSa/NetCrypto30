# 🚀 NetCrypto30 — My Networking & Cryptography Journey

**By Kristen | Women Techsters Fellow | Cybersecurity Track**

---

## 🌟 Overview
Welcome to my **NetCrypto30** project — a 30-day challenge where I’m catching up on **Networking** while keeping pace with **Cryptography**.

This journey is about showing up every day, learning consistently, and sharing my progress publicly to stay accountable and inspire others who might be learning under tough conditions.

> Every router mistake, every broken lab, and every concept that finally clicks — it all counts.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Catch up on *Network+ fundamentals* (OSI, TCP/IP, Subnetting, DNS, IP Addressing, etc.)
- Complete the *Cisco Packet Tracer* course  
- Complete IBM SkillsBuild courses:  
  - *Computer Networking Basics: How Computers Communicate*  
  - *Introduction to Cybersecurity*  
- Master key *Cryptography* concepts (Ciphers, Hashing, PKI, Digital Certificates)
- Build small practical projects using GitHub resources
- Document everything — the struggles, wins, and lessons learned

## 📅 Daily Logs

### 🧩 Day 1 — Getting Started
**Focus:**  
- Cryptography for Dummies – Chapter 1 (pp. 9–16): What makes a cipher  
- IBM “Computer Networking Basics” – 15 minutes  
- Cisco Packet Tracer – setup & first interactions  

**Highlights:**  
- Learned how devices connect to routers and switches in Packet Tracer.  
- Accidentally mixed up a wireless router with a backup router (😂) — fixed it and learned through laughter.  
- Understood basic encryption terms like cipher, key, and plaintext.

**Reflection:**  
> I was worried my motivation would fade, but starting small made it easier to build momentum. One page, one packet, one lab at a time.

### 🔐 Day 2 — Hashing & Encryption
**Focus:**  
- Cryptography for Dummies – pages 17–21: Hashes & XOR  
- Continued Cisco Packet Tracer (15 minutes)  
- Reviewed Women Techsters lecture on asymmetric encryption  

**Highlights:**  
- Learned that *hashes* are one-way functions ensuring integrity.  
- Understood how asymmetric encryption uses a **public key** (encrypt) and **private key** (decrypt).  
- Led a mini review session with classmates and even ran a live encryption demo.

**Reflection:**  
> Leading others helped me understand better. Teaching is the ultimate test of learning.
